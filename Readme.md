## Education							       		
- M.S., Computer Engineering	    | Aizona State University (_August 2021_)	 			        		
- B.E., Instrumentation Technology  | B.M.S College of Engineering (_June 2016_)

## Work Experience
**Data Analyst/Scientist @ Dataseers.ai (_October _2021 - Present_)**
- Finetuning Large Language Models (LLM) like Falcon, llama and GPT to build Suspicious Activity Reports(SAR) based on the financial inputs. This model aims to automate current SAR filling process and increase efficiency.
- Developed a person identification system using image comparison techniques. ML methods like Siamese Network and CNN are used to train and infer for facial and signature recognition of our clients during on-boarding process.
- Built an end-to-end solution for merchant name extraction and matching. It uses an algorithm developed with a combination of levenshtein distance, phonetic matching and word vector comparison of names in our database with government affiliated databases. It performs with an accuracy of around 80%, saving the company millions. 
- Worked on customer high risk categorization project. Different clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, BIRCH were used to map customers to different risk categories. Accuracy of around 75% was achieved outperforming the current rule-based model.

**Research Assistant @ Arizona State Uinversity (_February _2019 - September _2021)**
- Defended Master thesis which encapsulates how Natural Language Processing techniques, like language understanding and Computer Vision techniques, like object detection and emotion detection can be applied on edge devices for multimedia art and meteorological sensing.
- Worked on Lens-less Image reconstruction using GANs. Our technique of using Wasserstein GAN loss for image reconstruction and PSF estimation outperformed existing method and was selected for WACV 2021.
- Built MaRTiny – A low-cost smart IoT weather station. This system measures meteorological parameters, counts pedestrian using Yolov3 and detects regions of shade. This $200 system is a potential replacement for an existing $20,000 setup.
- Developed algorithm to parse, pre-process and extract 3D point clouds of objects for Ouster and Velodyne lidars. This data was further used to perform object detection and segmentation using SqueezeSeg model.


## Publications
1. **WACV 2021**      –   “Robust Lensless Image Reconstruction via PSF Estimation” [pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Rego_Robust_Lensless_Image_Reconstruction_via_PSF_Estimation_WACV_2021_paper.pdf)

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In this paper we introduce a GAN (Generative Adverserial Network) based approach for lensless imaging which combines image reconstruction and point spread function (PSF) estimation. Through adversarial learning, it enhances reconstruction without explicit PSF knowledge at test time and improves generalization to diverse camera PSFs. This enables versatile use of lensless cameras in multi-camera applications without the need for separate model training for each camera.

2. **FRONTIER 2022**  –   “Martiny: A low cost biometeorological device with embedded computer vision” [pdf](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.866240/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Environmental_Science&id=866240)

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In this paper we introduce a new device **MaRTiny**, a low-cost thermal and visual sensing AI device, addressing limitations of current expensive and bulky MRT measurement systems. MaRTiny integrates meteorological sensing through various sesnors, detects human presence through computer vision, and applies machine learning algorithms to estimate Mean Radiant Temperature, offering a promising tool for studying human behavior in extreme heat and informing urban design for effective town planning and development.

3. MDPI 2020      –   “ODO: Design of Multimodal Chatbot for an Experiential Media System” [pdf](https://www.mdpi.com/2414-4088/4/4/68)


<div style="text-align: justify">
In this paper we introduces a multimodal chatbot, named ODO, designed for interactive theater performances. ODO's architecture includes vision and natural language processing capabilities, embodied in a non-anthropomorphic movable LED array on stage. Able to engage with up to five users simultaneously, ODO performs tasks such as face detection, emotion classification, crowd movement tracking via mobile phones, and real-time conversation to guide users through nonlinear stories and interactive games. ODO serves as a tangible embodiment of a distributed multimedia system, overcoming technical challenges to offer users a distinctive experience through innovative interaction in the theater setting.
